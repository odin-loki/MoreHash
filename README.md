# MoreHash
Want to make a Native Windows Bruteforce Hash Cracker that saves the Tables generated as a Rainbow Table, uses ZStd Compression and works with Intel OpenCL, Intel TBB and possible any Intel Cryptographic Libs. Ideally I want everything to be platform independant and to work with Intel MPI. The program Will generate passwords with Lexigraphical Combinatorics on a CPU, I am considering generating the passwords to be hashed as UTF-16 ranges (for multi lingual cracking) represented as numbers (for optimisation), this will be done on the CPU and pass to be GPU to be hashed with a OpenCL Kernel. Data will I/O in 8 Megabyte blocks possibly a second or less. Consideration for Data I/O is a Single SSD as the Bottleneck. I got the Combinatorics Books and research papers. I just need time to read through them. Expect the project to take a few years. Cross Platform Cryptographic Librarys verification will take some time too without a Propietary Implementation. Intel Compiler was obtained on an Open Source Developer Licence and Visual Studio 2019 Plugins are used. Any problems with licencing contact me via email. ZStd Library is poorly written. Will look for a better example, I refuse to use the Linux one. Most MIT code these days is fucking shit. Program at finish should be Multi Lingual with textfile resource files and Console Templates. Console UI and User Actions has been mapped.
