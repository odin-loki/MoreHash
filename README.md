# MoreHash
Want to make a Native Windows Bruteforce Hash Cracker that saves the Tables generated as a Rainbow Table, uses ZStd Compression and works with Intel OpenCL, Intel TBB and possible any Intel Cryptographic Libs. Ideally I want everything to be platform independant and to work with Intel MPI. The program Will generate passwords with Lexigraphical Combinatorics on a CPU, I am considering generating the passwords to be hashed as UTF-16 ranges (for multi lingual cracking) represented as numbers (for optimisation), this will be done on the CPU and pass to be GPU to be hashed with a OpenCL Kernel. Data will I/O in 8 Megabyte blocks possibly a second or less. Consideration for Data I/O is a Single SSD as the Bottleneck. I got the Combinatorics Books and research papers. I just need time to read through them. Expect the project to take a few years. Cross Platform Cryptographic Librarys verification will take some time too without a Propietary Implementation. Intel Compiler was obtained on an Open Source Developer Licence and Visual Studio 2019 Plugins are used. Any problems with licencing contact me via email.
